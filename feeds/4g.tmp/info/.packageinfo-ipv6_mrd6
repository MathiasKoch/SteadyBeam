Description:  Multicast is becoming a major component in next generation networks, used 
 in several scenarios, from video broadcasting to multimedia conferencing. 
 In order to be implemented, new technology needs supporting hardware and 
 software across a set of devices and systems. MRD6 is an implementation of 
 a modular IPv6 Multicast Routing Framework for the Linux operating system 
 and provides MLDv2 (as well as MLDv1), PIM-SM and MBGP support.
