Title: NAT Port Mapping Protocol (NAT-PMP) library
Maintainer: 
Source: libnatpmp-20110808.tar.gz
Type: ipkg
Description:     libnatpmp is an attempt to make a portable and fully compliant implementation
  of the protocol for the client side. It is based on non blocking sockets and
  all calls of the API are asynchronous. It is therefore very easy to integrate
  the NAT-PMP code to any event driven code.
  This package contains the shared library.
